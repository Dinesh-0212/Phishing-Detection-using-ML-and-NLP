The primary aim of this project is to develop an advanced phishing detection system using Machine Learning(ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to improve the accuracy and adaptability of phishing detection. Phishing attacks have become a major cybersecurity threat, tricking users into revealing sensitive information such as login credentials, financial details, and personal data. Traditional phishing detection methods, such as blacklist-based filtering and heuristic rule-based systems, often fail to detect new and sophisticated phishing attempts. This project addresses these limitations by implementing a stackingbased ML approach that combines multiple classifiers to enhance detection accuracy while reducing false positives.
The scope of this project extends beyond conventional phishing detection mechanisms by incorporating NLPbased feature extraction and URL analysis. The system analyzes email content, subject lines, and structural properties using TF-IDF vectorization and lexical analysis to detect phishing attempts more effectively.Additionally, the project includes URL classification, examining domain reputation, URL length, and character patterns to identify fraudulent links. The system is designed to handle various types of phishing attacks, including email phishing, spear-phishing, smishing (SMS phishing), and URL-based phishing.
Furthermore, the project aims to create a real-time phishing detection platform with a user-friendly web interface, allowing users to input emails or URLs for immediate classification. The system is built to be scalable, adaptable, and capable of learning from new phishing techniques over time. By integrating ML, NLP, and ensemble learning techniques, this project provides a comprehensive cybersecurity solution that enhances phishing detection accuracy, minimizes false positives, and improves overall digital security.
